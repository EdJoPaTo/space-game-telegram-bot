      This is a game about exploration, fighting and economics in a sector of solar systems.


      At the start of the game you are docked at a space station.
      Space stations are safe harbors where you can store your assets, trade and produce goods.


      Once you undock from the station you are in space next to the station.
      Your menu shows the modules your ship has and some ship functions.
      The first modules are targeted, so you need to choose a target for them.
      The other modules are untargeted and work once activated.
      You can also use facilities at the same site (for example docking at a station).
      In order to get from one site to another you can warp.


      One solar system contains multiple sites.
      For example the one at the station is a site.
      There are other sites like the ones at stargates or asteroid fields.
      In the beginning it might be interesting to warp towards an asteroid field.


      Asteroid fields contain asteroids.
      Sometimes some pirates are just waiting there for explorers to be looted.
      Use your Laser to attack the pirate.
      Also, your armor repair is quite helpful.
      If you don’t manage to kill the pirate your ship will explode and one of your many clones will wake up at your home station.
      You will also get a new Rookie Ship as your old one is probably junked and looted already.
      Don’t worry, Rookie Ships are free.


      Once the pirates are gone you can mine the asteroids without getting disturbed.


      Good luck!

      Once you undock you are in space.
      This is either in a site or in warp.


      While you are in a site you can choose of different actions like using modules or ship utilities.
      Every few sections all actions of a site are executed and the next round in the site begins.
      You will get a message for the new round and what has happened.
      This message also contains your current location (solarsystem and site), ship stats and other entities in the same site.


      Your current location is uniquely described as solarsystem and site.
      Also the security of the current solarsystem is interesting.
      Higher security means more guards but also less valuable resources.


      You ship stats are looking somewhat like this:

      Abis (Rookie Ship)

      🛡Armor: 0.0% 0/30

      ⚙️Structure: 50.0% 5/10

      🔋Capacitor: 62.5% 25/40 (+5/r)

      📦Cargo: 0.0% 0/20


      First the name of the used ship layout and its ship class are stated.
      In this case its the Abis which is a Rookie Ship.
      Then other stats of the ship are listed.

      Armor and structure are defensive.
      Once your ship has no structure left, it breaks.

      The capacitor is needed in order to active modules.
      Modules cost energy which the capacitor provides.
      Also your ship is generating energy each round, in this case 5 per round.

      The last statistic is the cargo.
      Your ship can fit a certain amount of items.
      You will pack some items like ammunition and you will find some items like loot or ore.


      The last part of the message are other entities in the same site.
      This are other players, asteroids, facilities like stations, NPCs, …
      You can use your targeted modules in their direction.
      Try different things and remember, when something explodes, its called fun.
  stations:
    title: Stations
    text: >
      There are multiple stations all over the universe.
      Many systems even have multiple stations.
      Stations are a safe place.
      Everything that is docked wont explode ;)


      Stations are a place to store your goods and trade with them.
      You can repair and store your ships.


      Keep in mind that every station is unique.
      Items stored in one stations wont be in another station.
      This is also true for the market.
      You can only buy and sell items at the same station.
  shipFittings:
    title: Ship Fittings
    text: >
      In order to get from one place to another you will need a ship.
      Your beginner ship, the Rookie Ship is the Abis.
      Its a fairly simple ship layout.


      Imagine you want to mine ore or want to hunt pirates.
      For certain activities you can adapt your ship to be even better suited.

      This is possible with ship fittings.


      You ship has 3 kinds of modules.
      Targeted, untargeted and passive modules.
      Targeted modules can be activated onto another entity in the same site.
      Untargeted modules can be activated without targeted.
      Passive modules are always active as long as they are fitted into your ship.


      You are also limited by the amount of CPU and Powergrid a ship layout has to offer.
      Different ship layouts can have more or less module slots or infrastructure.
      You should choose the ship layout that fits your needs and budget.
      Keep in mind that bigger ships will have more infrastructure but are also way easier to hit.
      Larger isnt always better.
      Also larger ships are probably more expensive to loose.

    When you want to create buy or sell orders, use /wtb or /wts.
  wtbCommand: >
    With this command you 'want to buy/sell' something on the /market.
    You have to be docked and you need the parts of the order.


    This command has 3 arguments: The Item you want to trade, the amount of items you want to trade and the price (paperclips) per item.
    It should look like one of the following examples:

    <code>/wtb Aromit 1 1</code>
  wtbPrice1: Trying to buy something for 1 paperclip is kinda lame… I'll just assume you don't want to be lame.

    The bureaucrats are going to handle your order soon.

    But dont wait for them.
    They are probably sleeping anyway.
