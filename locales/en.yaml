  Hey ${from.first_name}!

    This is a game about exploration, fighting and economics in a sector of solar systems.


    At the start of the game you are docked at a space station.
    Space stations are safe harbors where you can store your assets, trade and produce goods.


    Once you undock from the station you are in space next to the station.
    Your menu shows the modules your ship has and some ship functions.
    The first modules are targeted, so you need to choose a target for them.
    The other modules are untargeted and work once activated.
    You can also use facilities at the same site (for example docking at a station).
    In order to get from one site to another you can warp.


    One solar system contains multiple sites.
    For example the one at the station is a site.
    There are other sites like the ones at stargates or asteroid fields.
    In the beginning it might be interesting to warp towards an asteroid field.


    Asteroid fields contain asteroids.
    Sometimes some pirates are just waiting there for explorers to be looted.
    Use your Laser to attack the pirate.
    Also, your armor repair is quite helpful.
    If you don’t manage to kill the pirate your ship will explode and one of your many clones will wake up at your home station.
    You will also get a new Rookie Ship as your old one is probably junked and looted already.
    Don’t worry, Rookie Ships are free.


    Once the pirates are gone you can mine the asteroids without getting disturbed.


    Good luck!

    When you want to create buy or sell orders, use /wtb or /wts.
  wtbCommand: >
    With this command you 'want to buy/sell' something on the /market.
    You have to be docked and you need the parts of the order.


    This command has 3 arguments: The Item you want to trade, the amount of items you want to trade and the price (paperclips) per item.
    It should look like one of the following examples:

    <code>/wtb Aromit 1 1</code>
  wtbPrice1: Trying to buy something for 1 paperclip is kinda lame… I'll just assume you don't want to be lame.

    The bureaucrats are going to handle your order soon.

    But dont wait for them.
    They are probably sleeping anyway.
