  main: This is some example help text.
  marketCommand: >
    You can inspect the market of a specific item with this command.

    This commands takes one argument which is the item.
    For example take a look on the current Aromit market like this:

    /market_Aromit


    When you want to create buy or sell orders, use /wts or /wtb.
  marketDocked: You have to be docked to buy or sell something.
  wtbCommand: >
    With this command you 'want to buy/sell' something on the /market.
    You have to be docked and you need the parts of the order.


    This command has 3 arguments: The Item you want to trade, the amount of items you want to trade and the paperclips per item.
    It should look like one of the following examples:

    <code>/wtb Aromit 1 1</code>
  wtbPrice1: Trying to buy something for 1 paperclip is kinda lame… I'll just assume you don't want to be lame.
  wtbSuccessful: The beaurocrats are going to handle your order soon.
