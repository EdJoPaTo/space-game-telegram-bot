// An instruction is something a player wants to get done when the round changes into the next.
// Frontend writes and Backend executes / clears them.
// Some actions might take multiple rounds (start warp, speed up, …) which requires the frontend to read the instructions again after each round.
// They are written and read by both frontend and backend!
